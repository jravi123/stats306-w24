## Question 2 - Starwars Characters

Investigate the data set starwars. Answer the following

> - How many characters are listed?
> - What kind of data is the mass column?
> - What kind of data is the species column?
> - Explain what the value NA means in the hair_color column.
> - How many characters are from Tatooine?
> - For humans, what is the average (mean) age?

```{r}
## number of characters?
nrow(starwars)
## Mass (probably in kg) is "numeric" or quantitative
class(starwars$mass)
## Species is character data, which is categorical/nominal.
class(starwars$species)

## NA represents missing values. Many of these characters are robots or other kinds of species that have no hair.

## Characters from Tatooine
filter(starwars, homeworld == "Tatooine") |> nrow()

## Common mistake: use length(), length() gives you column numbers
filter(starwars, homeworld == "Tatooine") |> length()

## average birth year for human
filter(starwars, species == "Human") |> summarize( mean(birth_year, na.rm = TRUE))

```


## Questions 3

Create a scatter plot of the columns height and mass from the starwars data set. What jumps out from the plot? Do a little investigation to find out about that point.

```{r}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point()
```

Humans should point out that large point. What is this?

```{r}
filter(starwars, mass > 500)
```

Create a data set that excludes the outlier from the previous question. Plot the relationship for height and mass again. Add a smoothed regression line. Interpret these results for the nature of relationship between height and mass.

```{r}
starwars_small <- filter(starwars, mass < 500)
ggplot(data = starwars_small, aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() # stat_smooth also ok
```




## Today's Content

> - Today's lab combines both conceptual problems and coding
> - Covers topics covered until last week: (ggplot, data manipulation...)


## Problem 1

> - Take a glimpse at the first six rows of the `mpg` data.
> - What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r mpg, exercise = T}
head(mpg)
```

```{r classVsdrv,  exercise = T}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
  geom_point()
```



## Problem 2

> - Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
> - How would you fix this problem (use the code cell below)? 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```


```{r aesthetics, exercise = T}
## fix the problem
```


## Problem 3
 > - What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
 > - Use the plot below as a hint.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ cty)
```


## Problem 4
> - Discuss how to obtain each of the plot below
