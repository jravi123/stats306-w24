```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(2939394)

table1 <- bind_cols(tidyr::table1, continent = c("Asia", "Asia", "South America", "South America", "Asia", "Asia"))

table2 <- pivot_longer(table1, c("cases", "population"))

table4ab <- pivot_wider(table1, id_cols = c("country", "continent"), names_from = "year", values_from = c("cases", "population"))

if (!require(nycflights13)) install.packages("nyclfights13", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

```

## Review

* Tidy/wide data: rows are observations, columns are measurements
* Tall formats: one column holds more than one type of measurement
* `pivot_longer`: wide to tall
* `pivot_wider`: tall to wide
* naming columns, setting types, splitting into multiple columns


## Example: Tidy/Wide

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```
```{r}
table1
```


What are the units? What are the measurments?

## Example: Tall table
```{r echo = FALSE}
```
```{r}
table2
```

## Relational data

Sometimes we have multiple levels of data. For example,

>* Students with Courses
>* Customers with Orders
>* Players with Games

It may be inefficient to duplicate related information

Solution: **relate** in two tidy tables.


## Example: Relational

```{r, echo= FALSE}
table3_countries <- group_by(table1, country) |> summarize(continent = first(continent))
table3_years <- tidyr::table1
```

```{r}
table3_countries 
table3_years
```

## `nycflights13` library

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

Tables:

>* `airlines`: information on the carriers
>* `airports`: information on airports
>* `planes`: the planes flying between airports
>* `weather`: weather conditions
>* `flights`: flight information and connects the other tables

## `airlines`

```{r}
airlines
```

## `airports`

```{r}
airports
```

## `planes`

```{r}
planes
```

## `weather`

```{r}
weather
```

## `flights`

```{r}
flights
```

## Keys

A **key** is one or more columns that uniquely identify a on observation within the data set.

A **primary key** identifies entries within a table.

Single columns: `airports/faa`, `planes/tailnum`,  `airlines/carrier`

Multiple columns:
>* `weather`: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour` (could be a single date-time column), `origin` (location)
>* `flights`: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `flight`, `origin`, `dest`

## Foreign keys

A **foreign key** relates an observation in one table to observation in a second table.

>* `flights`: `tailnum` uniquely identifies plane used
>* `weather`: `origin` identifies airport

## Finding primary keys

Without a diagram, how can you figure out a primary key? It should only apply to one observation:

```{r}
count(airports, faa) |> summarize(any(n > 1))
```


Could the `flight` column uniquely identify the flights?
```{r}
count(flights, flight) |> summarize(any(n > 1))
```

Smallest set of columns I could find:
```{r}
count(flights, flight, year, origin, dest, 
      month, day, hour, minute) |> summarize(any(n > 1))
```

## Exercise

Find a minimal set of columns that create a primary key for the `mpg` table:

```{r}
colnames(mpg)
```


```{r mpgkey, exercise = TRUE}
count(mpg, manufacturer) |> summarize(any(n > 1))
```



## Relations

When we connect two tables by keys, we have created a **relation**.  We classify relations by how many rows from the **left table** are connected to how many rows from the **right table**. A relation is a **table** with one row for each pair of connected keys.

* one-to-one: one row from the left is connected to one table from the right (this might be a subset of the rows from one or both tables)
* one-to-many: one row from left table is connected to one or more rows of the second table. Left table rows appear multiple times in the relation table.
* many-to-many: both left and right tables contribute multiple rows.

## Creating relations: joins

From our book:

* **Mutating joins**: add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.
* **Filtering joins**: filter observations from one table based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

## Types of joins

* **Left (outer) joins**: one or more rows for each row in left table
* **Right (outer) joins**: one or more rows for each in right table
* **Full (outer) joins**: at least one row for each row in both tables
* **Inner joins**: rows for each combination of matching keys in both tables

## Venn Diagram of joins

![Venn diagrm of joins](images/join-venn.png)

## One-to-one join: carrier names

```{r}
fiveam <- filter(flights, year == 2013, month == 1, day == 1, hour == 5)
select(fiveam, flight, carrier)
```

```{r}
left_join(x = fiveam,
          y = airlines,
          by = "carrier") |> 
  select(flight, carrier, name) 
```

## Multiple one-to-one

If we need to link more than two tables (or two tables more than one time), we build up several joins

```{r}
select(fiveam, flight, origin, dest)
```

```{r}
tmp <- left_join(fiveam, airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))
select(tmp, flight, origin, name)
```

```{r}
left_join(tmp, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |>
  select(flight, origin, dest, name.x, name.y)
```

>* When the same column appears in both tables, it gets the `.x` (left) and `.y` (right) suffix
>* Notice that this is a **left** join because BQN doesn't have a `name.y` entry.

## Slightly cleaner example

```{r}
left_join(fiveam, airports, by = c("origin" = "faa")) |>
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"), suffix = c("_origin", "_dest")) |>
  select(flight, name_origin, name_dest)
```

## Exercise

Join the `flights` and `plains` tables using a `left_join` on `tailnum`. Plot the distribution of flight speed `distance / air_time` against `type`.

```{r speed, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Exercise

The California has an Eastern-most longitude (approx.) of -115. Using the `flights` and the `airports` table, use a join to plot the distribution of scheduled departure time (`sched_dep_time`) from NYC broken out by West coast flights (destination `lon < -115`) and otherwise.

```{r rockyflights, exercise = TRUE}

```
