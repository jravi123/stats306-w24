sonnet18 <- "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date;\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\nNor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:\n\tSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n\tSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee."

## Review

* `nycflights` data: flights, airlines, airports, planes, weather
* Keys: **primary keys** identify data within the table, **foreign keys** link to data in other tables.
* Relations: tables created by **joining** two or more tables. Classify as: mutating or filtering.
* Types of joins: outer: left, right, and fulll; inner
* Use of `dplyr` `*_join` functions, `by` argument, `suffix` argument

## Example: What models of planes fly from NYC to Detroit?

```{r}
filter(flights, dest == "DTW") |>
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum") |>
  count(paste(manufacturer, model)) |> arrange(desc(n))
```


## Inner joins

Inner joins discard entries where a key does not exist in the table. Recall not all destinations are in the airports table (international flights):

```{r}
fiveam <- filter(flights, year == 2013, month == 1, day == 1, hour == 5)
left_join(fiveam, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |>
  select(flight, dest, name)
```

Inner join would discard that row:
```{r}
inner_join(fiveam, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |>
  select(flight, dest, name)
```

## Exercise

Use an inner join to find out how many domestic flights there were during the period covered by the `flights` data set.

```{r innerjoin, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Full joins

Left and right joins keep all rows in the respective table (discarding in the other freely). **Full joins** keep all:

```{r}
left <- head(flights, 10)
right <- filter(airports, faa %in% c("DTW", "BOS", "ORD", "LAX", "ATL"))
left_join(left, right, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |> select(flight, dest, name)
right_join(left, right, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |> select(flight, dest, name)
full_join(left, right, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |> select(flight, dest, name)
inner_join(left, right, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |> select(flight, dest, name)
```

## Multiple matches

Recall that we limited ourseleves to 5 airport codes. Notice the number of rows in this join:

```{r}
right_join(left, right, by = c("dest" = "faa")) |> select(flight, dest, name)
```

If A's key matches more than one row in B, A gets duplicated that many times. (This is different than `mutate`.)

Note, same behavior with a left join:

```{r}
# swapping order of table
left_join(right, left, by = c("faa" = "dest")) |> select(flight, faa, name)
```


## Keys with multiple columns

Examples thus far have used keys in single columns, but keys can be spread across columns (**compound**). 

```{r}
left_join(fiveam, weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "hour", "origin")) |>
  select(flight, temp, wind_dir, wind_speed)
```

## Natural joins

To avoid lost of redundant typing, if two tables have a set of columns in common, those will automatically be used to join (**natural join**)

```{r}
left_join(fiveam, weather) |>
  select(flight, temp, wind_dir, wind_speed)
```

## Matching multiple keys

What would have happened if the `weather` table used the column name `airport` instead of `origin`? Since `airport` is not a column in `flights`:

```{r}
left_join(fiveam, weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "hour")) |>
  select(flight, origin.x, temp, wind_speed, origin.y)
```

In a left join, if the same key matches multiple tables in the right, the row gets duplicated for each.

Lesson: Be careful with natural joins and compound keys.

## Filtering joins

A few times we used the fact that **outer joins** will result in tables with missing entries in order to count some feature.

This pattern is common enough to generate two **filtering join** functions:

- `semi_join(x, y)` keeps all observations in x that have a match in y.
- `anti_join(x, y)` drops all observations in x that have a match in y.

Big difference from mutating joins is that `y`'s columns are not included.

## Example

Suppose we want to find the top 10 destinations by number of flights:

```{r}
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)
top_dest
```

If we *join* to the `top_dest` table, we can get flights to those destinations:

```{r}
left_join(flights, top_dest) |> # natural join on `dest` column
  select(flight, dest, n) -> flights_to_tops
flights_to_tops
```
Then filtering out the NAs
```{r}
filter(flights_to_tops, !is.na(n))
```

Do it one step with `semi_join`:

```{r}
semi_join(flights, top_dest) |>
  select(flight, dest)
```

## Exercise

Find the set of flights that were delayed by more than one hour (`dep_delay > 60`). Find the weather patterns associated with those flights and plot the distribution of wind speed with length of delay.

```{r semijoin, exercise = TRUE}
# you can use a natural join for flights and weather

```

## Other set operations functions

Base R has a series of **set operation** functions that operate on collects as mathematical sets (collections where items can appear at most once): `intersect`, `union`, `setdiff`, `setequal`, `is.element`, `%in%`

I frequently use these for doing comparisons of vectors:
```{r}
"DTW" %in% top_dest$dest # same as is.element
intersect(c("BOS", "LAX", "DTW"), top_dest$dest)
union(c("A", "B", "C"), c("Q", "A", "R"))
setdiff(c("A", "B", "C"), c("Q", "A", "R"))
setequal(c("A", "B", "C"), c("B", "C", "A"))
```

## Set operations with tables

With filtering joins, we can choose which columns link the tables. With the set operations, we must use all columns.

Flights to top destinations that are also delayed:
```{r}
flights_to_top <- semi_join(flights, top_dest) 
flights_delayed <- filter(flights, dep_delay > 0)
intersect(flights_to_top, flights_delayed)
```

## Relational data wrap up

* When data are stored in more than one table you need to **join**
* **Mutating joins** join tables to add columns (and some times rows!)
* **Filtering joins** use one table to select rows for another
* Outer left/right/full joins, inner joins
* Also useful for linking table to itself 
* Set operations less generally useful, but have some specific uses (e.g., vectors)
